# Console Finances

## Description

A simple Javascript (js) console program that calculates profits, average change, the biggest increase and decrease. The finance data it pulls from is a hardcoded 2d array.

Variables are named camelCase.

## How to use

Run the html file or go to the site (https://aliochinmax.github.io/Console-Finaces/), if alerts are turned off look in the console. Js is required for it to run.

If you wish to replace the data set: ensure it is a 2d array, with the first field being a string representing a date, and the second field being amount lost or profited for that time interval. Array that requires replacing is called finances and is labelled as data set.
